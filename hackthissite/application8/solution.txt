I know nothing.

This program is written in visual basic(most probably)

Disassembly shows that a "je" instruction control the display of "success" message and answer with it. The instruction is at
0x407163 of analysis.txt. Using hex editor and instruction hex code, it is found in app8win.exe. Then those instruction is replaced
with 6 "nop"(0x90).
